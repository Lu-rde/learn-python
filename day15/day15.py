# Day 15: Inheritance & Polymorphism

'''
1. Inheritance: Allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent).
2. Polymorphism: Let's have different classes implement the same method in different ways.
'''

# ---Inheritance Example---
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name=name

    def speak (self):
        print (f"{self.name} makes a sound.")

# Dog inherits from Animal

class Dog (Animal):
    def speak (self):
        print (f"{self.name} says Woof!")

class Cat (Animal):
    def speak (self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Meow!")

dog = Dog ("Buddy")
cat = Cat ("Lila")

dog.speak ()
cat.speak()

'''
So here, Dog and Cat inherited the Animal class but overrode the `speak()` method. 
This is polymorphism in action — the same method name behaves differently depending on the object.
'''

#---Polymorphism using functions---
def animal_sound (animal):
    animal.speak()

animal_sound (dog)
animal_sound (cat)

'''
Even though the function `animal_sound()` takes an `animal`, 
it works for any object that has a `speak()` method - this is also polymorphism.

# One more example with shape 
class Shape:
    def area (self):
        print ("Area not defined for generic shape")

class Circle (Shape):
    def __init__ (self, radius):
        self.radius=radius
    def area (self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

class Square (Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side
    def area (self):
        return self.side ** 2

shapes = [Circle(5), Square(4)]

for s in shapes :
    print(f"Area: {s.area()}")
