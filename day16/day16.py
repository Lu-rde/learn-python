# Day 16: Decorators & Generators

#---Decorators---

'''
A decorator is just a function that takes another function as input, adds some extra behavior, and returns a new function.
'''

# Basic decorator example
def my_decorator (func):
    def wrapper ():
        print ("Before the function runs")
        func()
        print ("After the function runs")

    return wrapper 

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

say_hello()

'''
Here, `say_hello()` is wrapped by `my_decorator`. 
When I call `say_hello()`, it actually calls the `wrapper()` function.
'''

# Decorator with arguments
def greet_decorator (func):
    def wrapper (name):
        print ("Getting ready to greet...")
        func (name)
        print ("Finished greeting!\n")
    return wrapper 

@greet_decorator 
def greet (name):
    print (f"Hello, {name}!")

greet ("Lucía")
greet ("Alejandra")

# ---Generators---

'''
A generator is a function that returns an iterator using the `yield` keyword.
Unlike regular functions that return a value and exit, generators maintain their state.
'''

def countdown (n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n-=1

# Using the generator
for number in countdown (5):
    print (number)

'''
This doesn't store all values in memory like a list. It yields them one by one — (super efficient)
'''

# Generator expression (similar to list comprehension)
squares = (x**2 for x in range (5))

for s in squares :
    print (f"Square: {s}")

''' 
Generators are great when working with large datasets or infinite sequences.
