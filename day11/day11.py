# Day 11: File & Exception Handling

# ---File Handling---

# Writing to a file 
with open ("sample.txt", "w") as file :
    file.write ("Hello, this is my first file in python !\n")
    file.write ("Writing to files is surprisingly easy. \n")

    """
    This creates a completely new text file in our project and writes in it 
    what we tell it to.
    """

# Appending to the same file
with open ("sample.txt", "a") as file:
    file .write ("This line was added later using append mode. \n")

# Reading from a file 
print ("Reading contents from 'sample.txt' :\n")
with open ("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content=file.read()
    print(content)

"""
This way we can run the text through the terminal.
"""

# Reading line by line 
print ("Reading line by line:")
with open ("sample.txt", "r")as file:
    for line in file:
        print ("->", line.strip())

'''
The `with` keyword handles closing the file automatically, so I don't have to call file.close().
'''

# --- Exception Handling ---

print("Now trying exception handling:")

try: 
    num = int(input("Enter a number to divide 100 by: "))
    result =100/ num
    print (f"Result: {result}")

except ValueError :
    print ("That wasn't a number !")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print ("Can´t divide by zero!")
except Exception as e :
    print (f"Some unexpected error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    print("Try-Except block finished.\n")

'''
The try-except block is useful to catch and handle potential errors during runtime.
Using multiple except blocks lets me handle specific types of exceptions.
The finally block always runs, no matter what.
'''
# Checking if a file exists before reading
import os

filename = "sample.txt"
if os.path.exists(filename):
    print(f"Yes, '{filename}' exists!")
else:
    print(f"File '{filename}' not found.")
